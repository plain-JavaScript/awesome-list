## Coding Playgrounds

>[Coding Playgrounds] are web applications that allow real-time editing and previews of client-side codes: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The best part of these coding playgrounds is that most of them are free and you can easily share a “playground” with someone either for teaching purposes or for debugging.
