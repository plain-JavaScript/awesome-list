## Wikipedia ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

Wikipedia is a good place to start because it provides overviews including the vocabulary you may encounter, the history of the effort and links to the range of available resources.

The Categories section at the bottom of the article opens up to display an extensive array of resources.

## Wikibooks: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript

>The Wikibook on hand is intended as a guide for WEB developers who want to learn the basics of the programming language JavaScript. It offers short descriptions of concepts, syntax, context, and JavaScript-related technologies, as well as code examples and exercises. Additional links lead the reader to in-depth information regarding the more complex features and such issues that have a loose relation to JavaScript. Especially the Wikiversity course "JavaScript Programming" offers a rich set of additional details and links to YouTube learning videos.

The JavaScript Wikibook provides a detailed overview of the language. It's more of a reference manual people with some JavaScript experience than a learning resources for beginners. As with many Wiki efforts, it's great in some places and lacking in others. Perhapd the biggest issue is that it is no always up to date with features in the latest releases. For example, [Arrays#Properties_and_methods]( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Arrays#Properties_and_methods ) leaves out many options. Perhaps, the greatest strengths are the extensive lists of links to relevant resources.


## Wikiversity: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/JavaScript_Programming

>This course comprises 16 lessons on JavaScript programming. Each lesson includes a combination of Wikipedia and Internet-based readings, YouTube videos, and hands-on learning activities. The entire course can be downloaded in book form by selecting "Download Learning Guide" in the sidebar.

The material in the Wikiversity JavaScript course appear to be a great resource for helping teachers prepare college and advanced highschool level courses.
