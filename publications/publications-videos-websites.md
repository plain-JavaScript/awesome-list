## dotJS 2017 - Adrian Holovaty - A framework author's case against frameworks ~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvOsegaN9Wk
> Adrian cowrote Django, a prominent server-side framework, yet he has come to believe that front-end frameworks are unnecessary for his own projects. Here's his impassioned argument for avoiding JavaScript frameworks on the front end.


## Background ~ Web Sites

## Frameworkless Movement ~ https://www.frameworklessmovement.org/

> The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt and the availability of alternatives given by the vanilla language or by dedicated libraries.

>Principles
>Every time that we consider the choice of a framework for a project we will use these principles to guide our choices.
>* The value of a software is not the code itself but in the reasons behind the existence of that code.
>* Every decision should be made considering the context. A good choice in a given context could be a bad choice in another one.
>* The mindful choice of a framework is a technical one and should be made by technical people, taking business needs into account.
>* The decision-making criteria that led to the choice of a framework should be known to all the members in the team.

The ideas of the Frameworkless Movement may be applied to any language, not just JavaScript.
