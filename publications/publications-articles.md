The terms "Vanilla JavaScript", "Pure JavaScript" and "Plain JavaScript" are used quite frequently, but there are no hard and fast rules as to what these actually mean. On the web there appear to be just a few articles that attempt to define the category. Below are links to some of the articles we've found so far.


## Jérôme Beau: "Design: #noFramework" 2022-02-27 ~ https://javarome.medium.com/design-noframework-bbc00a02d9b3

>In the end, frameworks look like religions (or politics): each of them pretend to have the solution, but each of them is different. Each of them claim to provide the best vision of ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶l̶d̶ an app, but there are heated debates about which one holds the truth. Each of them requires you to follow specific rules and, while there may be similarities, it is always hard to convert from one to another.

>Let’s look at an “atheist” approach of frameworks: use none.

This article is a very long read covering a number of topics relating to the issues with building pages using frameworks. Nice use of summary bullets. The article incudes useful links - many of which are used in these pages. On the topic of JavaScript with no framework, it's the best summary of the issues with the most full set of links that we we have seen. _Merci beaucoup, Jérôme!_

## 2020? ~ Jeremy Likness ~ Vanilla.js (Series: 4 Parts Total) ~  https://blog.jeremylikness.com/series/vanilla.js

This page provides links to four of Jeremy's posts on vanilla .js

The posts are more of a "how-to do it" than "Why do it this way". The posts are well-organized and cover a good range of issues that developers face that can be solved with JavaScript alone.

Links with descriptions to two of the posts are listed just below.


## 2019-04-09 ~ Jeremy Likness ~ Vanilla.js — Getting Started ~ https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/2019-04-09_vanilla.jsgetting-started/

>Build web code with a zero-footprint web framework

>This guide shows you how to build and run a simple Vanilla.js app. You’ll use a text editor to develop your app and use the JavaScript language features that benefit every Vanilla.js project.

Here id the demo you will build:

## 2020-02-26 ~ Jeremy Likness: Build a Single Page Application (SPA) Site With Vanilla.js ~ https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/build-a-spa-site-with-vanillajs/

The one framework you don't have to install

>Modern JavaScript frameworks exist to address deficiencies in the capabilities provided out of the box by HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and WebAssembly. The latest stable version of JavaScript (ECMAScript® 2015) evolved significantly compared to earlier versions, with better control over scope, powerful string manipulation capabilities, destructuring, parameter enhancements, and the built-in implementation of classes and modules (there is no longer a need to use IIFEs or immediately-invoked function expressions). The purpose of this post is to explore how to build modern apps using the latest JavaScript features.

## 2020-10-08 ~ Jim Nielson ~ https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech/

>I have a number of old side projects which I occasionally have to revisit. The structure of these projects broadly falls under two categories:
>1. Ones I built with a mindset of having my starting point be the most basic, native web technology available. From that foundation, I enhanced functionality through layering on more sophisticated and experimental techniques, APIs, etc., where supported. All code was authored in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
>2. Ones I built with a mindset of having my starting point be abstractions of native web technology (frameworks, tooling, language sub/supersets).
>When I open an old project like number two (described above), I find entropy staring me back in the face: library updates, breaking API changes, refactored mental models, and possible downright obsolescence. An incredible amount of effort will be required to make a simple change, test it, and get it live.
>
>Conversely when I open an old project like number one (described above), I find myself relieved. A project authored in native web technologies, enhanced with an eye towards the future, with little or no tooling, leaves me facing few obstacles. Remove a couple shims that are no longer needed and that’s about it. Imagine that: you can remove code to update a project?

Nielson provides a short and rational summary as to why vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS is the most future-proof code you can write.

## 2013-12-06 ~ StackOverflow user13778911 ~ What is VanillaJS? ~ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20435653/what-is-vanillajs

>I have one simple question, that got stuck in my mind for a few days: What is VanillaJS? Some people refer to it as a framework, you can download a library from the official pages.

In referring to the "official pages, the poster is very likely referring to http://vanilla-js.com/

This website is a joke. It states "Vanilla JS is a fast, lightweight, cross-platform framework for building incredible, powerful JavaScript applications." It pretend that Vanilla JavaScript is a framework that can compete with jQuery, Dojo annd presumably React, Angular and others.

Unfortunately may naive people who google "vanilla JavaScript" get to this site and are very confused about things.

Because of the vanillajs.com  website and because [plain vanilla]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_vanilla ) is an English idiom that may not be familiar to non-English speakers, we tend tpo avoid its usage preferring "plain JavaScript".
