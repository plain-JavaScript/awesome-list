## Concept

At last, we come to the crux of the matter: source code! The best way to learn plain JavaScript is to to look at, play with and modify JavaScript source code. The following sections are a treasure trove of good, bad and indifferent examples for you to examine.

What is a source?

* A user or an organization with one or more repos that contain a number of plain JavaScript projects with demos
* Examples that use a small number of libraries are acceptable
* Repos where the examples have a common theme or show off a particular library are considered very cool
* The more examples the better - at least a dozen or more is nice
* Of course, having lots of stars, a great read me, informative tags really help.
