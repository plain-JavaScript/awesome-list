At last, we come to the crux of the matter: source code! The best way to learn plain JavaScript is to to look at, play with and modify JavaScript source code. The following sections are a treasure trove of good, bad and indifferent examples for you to examine.

What is a source?

* A user or an organization with one or more repos that contain a number of plain JavaScript projects with demos
* Examples that use a small number of libraries are acceptable
* Repos where the examples have a common theme or show off a particular library are considered very cool
* The more examples the better - at least a dozen or more is nice
* Of course, having lots of stars, a great read me, informative tags really help.

One of the great joys of JavaScript is the huge quantity of free, open-source scripts that developes make available for you to observe, enjoy and build upon. Many scripts are plain JavaScript and many other use libraries. There are thousands of people sharing their knowledge in this manner. Below is a work-in-progress list of developers listed alphabetically by first name (following the style of Wikipedia) with links to some of their efforts that might be relevant.
