# Reference ~ Technical Standards and Specifications


## Introduction

JavaScript is a language with a free and open source specification. The specification of JavaScript is an [International Standard]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard ) and is maintained by ecma-international.org. It is ISO/IEC 16262.

It is worth noting that only a few computer languages are maintained as technical standards. These include C, C++, COBOL, Fortran and Ruby. Note that PHP, Python, Perl, Swift and Rust are privately maintained.

## What are the technical standards important?

The technical standards for JavaScript are important because they specify how the language is meant to work. There a continuous effort to add new capabilities and to help prevent bad things from happening. In recent years the upgrades have been quite significant and beneficial. Therefore it is worth your time to stay up to date with the features and upcoming releases.

## How to stay up to date?

A number of online authors specialize in communications on JavaScript standard. One of the first that comes to mind:

## To Do

* 2023-01-19 ~ Demonstrate that software is not magic. Software such as JavaScript is the work effort, collaboration and consensus of thousands of people over the decades that create the standards listed here and elsewhere.
* 2023-01-19 ~ Overview of the complexity. Gather thoughts and links that provide an overview of the breadth and depth of the many standards involved
* Decide the standard of standards. There are so many standards and so many players. Deciding wjat standards we should talk about here will take time and effort.

>ECMAScript is a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different browsers. It is standardized by Ecma International in the document ECMA-262.

>ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server-side applications and services using Node.js and other runtime environments.


## W3 ~  https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script

>While the most common scripting language ECMAscript (more widely known as JavaScript) is developed by Ecma, a great many of the APIs made available in browsers have been defined at W3C.

Standards maintained by W3 include: Audio, Canvas, CORS, DOM, DOM events, EME File, Geolocation, IndexedDB, MSE, SSE, SVG, Video, WebAssembly, WebAuthn, WebGPU, WebRTC, WebSocket, WebXR, Web messaging, Web storage, Web worker, and XMLHttpRequest

## Khronos ~ https://www.khronos.org/

>Khronos royalty-free open standards for 3D graphics, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Parallel Computing, Machine Learning, and Vision Processing. Khronos develops and maintains WebGL ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL and WebCL.

W3 and Khronos are two organizations developing and maintaining standards use to generate libraries of software that are embedded in browsers and readily available to you as a JavaScript programmer.

## Mozilla ~ https://www.mozilla.org/

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla
> Mozilla (stylized as moz://a) is a free software community founded in 1998 by members of Netscape. The Mozilla community uses, develops, spreads and supports Mozilla products, thereby promoting exclusively free software and open standards, with only minor exceptions. The community is supported institutionally by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation and its tax-paying subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.

### WEB API ~ https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/api_other/

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

>When writing code for the Web, there are a large number of Web APIs available. Below is a list of all the APIs and interfaces (object types) that you may be able to use while developing your Web app or site.

* https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script

_Is there a better - more authoritative - listing of web APIs somewhere?_

Future editions may list more standards bodies that help regulate JavaScript features.
