## 2023-01-15 ~ @theo-armour

* Added Preface ~ 2023-01-15

### Was: Preface ~ 2023-01-15

### To Do

* Break this file up into separate Markdown files
* Early stage work-in-progress: Establish a format and style for entries. Then apply it to all the entries

GitHub is a primary source of many of the links here. Every GitHub user and organization has a standard format in the left column. I am looking for the quickest way to copying that text from GitHub, pasting it into the appropriate Markdown file here, then using the fewest keystrokes to restyle and format the text for here.

### Naming repos

"Kitchen Sink" is fun, but it may not be very meaningful out there in the GitHub world.

What is a better, more useful name? A popular current meme is "awesome list"

* "Awesome list of Plain JavaScript"
* "Awesome list of plain JavaScript links"


### Definitions

What is the difference between a "resource" and a "source"? It will be nive one day to have some good clear categories and tags for all out topics

* Added to and edited "Sources ~ People"

It's beginning to feel like there could be thousands of people listed here. I wonder what that means. What could be useful?

* a "phone book" of JavaScript peeps?
* A blog showcasing the best demos available on GitHub?

Tags will need work so as to help you find peeps of interest

Thinking out loud: It's probably time to break the kitchen sink into separate pages


## 2023-01-04 ~ @theo-armour

* Learned that internal links in documents intended for GitHub pages should have the location hasj with all lower case and spaces replaced by hyphens
* Added descriptions to the table of contents


## 2023-01-03 ~ @theo-armour
