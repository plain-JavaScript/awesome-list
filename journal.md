# Journal ~ Kitchen Sink

* Added to and edited "Sources ~ People"

It's beginning to feel like there could be thousands of people listed here. I wonder what that means. What could be useful?

* a "phone book" of JavaScript peeps?
* A blog showcasing the best demos available on GitHub?

Tags will need work so as to help you find peeps of interest

Thinking out loud: It's probably time to break the kitchen sink into separate pages

* Learned that internal links in documents intended for GitHub pages should have the location hasj with all lower case and spaces replaced by hyphens
* Added descriptions to the table of contents
