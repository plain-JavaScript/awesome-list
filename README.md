## Introduction

This repository provides lists of links to resources for developers of applications based on the JavaScript programming language. The particular emphasis here is on plain ["vanilla"]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software ) scripts that are simple, free and easy on the brain.

***

JavaScript is perhaps the [most widely used programming language]( https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages ). Almost any computing task - no matter how complicated - has been <s>hacked</s> [accomplished with JavaScript]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Jeff%20Atwood%20made,eventually%20be%20written%20in%20JavaScript.%E2%80%9D ). Some of the smartest people in the world investigate the most difficult issues using JavaScript.

But where does that leave us simple folk?

The good news:

The fastest, easiest and simplest way to get stuff on the Internet is: JavaScript

If you can type the following into a text file and drag that file into a browser, you may call yourself a programmer

``` JavaScript
<script>
    document.write("Hello, World!")
</script>
```

This repository is dedicated to helping us [KISS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle ) people play with JavaScript in simple, fun useful ways.

We want to show you that JavaScript covers a huge range of possibilities while at the same time demonstrating that much can be accomplished with tiny amounts of code.

### 2022-12-22

A new file: [journal.md]( https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/index.html#journal.md ) is added.

We are still dozens of links short of being ready to share with the world, but if you happen to stop by, please say hello by adding by opening an issue


## Target Audience

### Beginners

Are you a youngster and want to play with computers? A program that runs a JavaScript script is available on virtually computers, tablets and phones. Ditto the software to write programs - a text editor. So you can start today.


### STEAM skills but little programming experience

Are you an archeologist, violin maker, nurse-practitioner or just some one highly involved with technical things? As you already know software can provide benefit to almost any field of endeavor.

If you have never programmed, then JavaScript is fast easy way to start

If you have programmed, but aee looking to share your knowledge on the web, or create interactive apps to share or need the attributes of a game-like environment then JavaScript can be at your service.


### Programmers who write programs in languages that are not JavaScript

Are you a whizz at Python, and hold you nose when you have to lower yourself into JavaScript gobbledygook? Well, a lot of that stuff is all the tricks needed to be called a "full-stack developer". Well, if you don't need to call yourself a full-stack developer and just want to get some necessary things done in JavaScript, then there is a fully-documented, well-supported alternative: plain, ordinary JavaScript.

<br>

Well, you have come to the right place ( or will do when this list progresses a bit more)

## Reference

A reference is a link to a source of information. The links herein can help you understand the "who, what, when, where and why of JavaScript".


### Reference ~ Wikimedia Foundation projects relating to JavaScript

It's often worth starting any search on any topic by looking at what is available in thw Wikimedia "movement". Sp, here we go with a first look at JavaScript.

### Wikimedia ~ https://Wikimedia.org

>Wikimedia is a global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world.
>
>Through various projects, chapters, and the support structure of the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, Wikimedia strives to bring about a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.

### Wikipedia ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

Wikipedia is a good place to start because it provides overviews including the vocabulary you may encounter, the history of the effort and links to the range of available resources.

The Categories section at the bottom of the article opens up to display an extensive array of resources.


### Wikibooks: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript

>The Wikibook on hand is intended as a guide for WEB developers who want to learn the basics of the programming language JavaScript. It offers short descriptions of concepts, syntax, context, and JavaScript-related technologies, as well as code examples and exercises. Additional links lead the reader to in-depth information regarding the more complex features and such issues that have a loose relation to JavaScript. Especially the Wikiversity course "JavaScript Programming" offers a rich set of additional details and links to YouTube learning videos.

See also

* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Links

The JavaScript Wikibook provides a detailed overview of the language. It's more of a reference manual people with some JavaScript experience than a learning resources for beginners. As with many Wiki efforts, it's great in some places and lacking in others. Perhapd the biggest issue is that it is no always up to date with features in the latest releases. For example, [Arrays#Properties_and_methods]( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Arrays#Properties_and_methods ) leaves out many options. Perhaps, the greatest strengths are the extensive lists of links to relevant resources.


### Wikiversity: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/JavaScript_Programming

>This course comprises 16 lessons on JavaScript programming. Each lesson includes a combination of Wikipedia and Internet-based readings, YouTube videos, and hands-on learning activities. The entire course can be downloaded in book form by selecting "Download Learning Guide" in the sidebar.

The material in the Wikiversity JavaScript course appear to be a great resource for helping teachers prepare college and advanced highschool level courses.


See also a variety of other JavaScript references in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikimedia_sister_projects

### Reference ~ Technical Standards and Specifications

JavaScript is a language with a free and open source specification. The specification of JavaScript is an [International Standard]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard ) and is maintained by ecma-international.org. It is ISO/IEC 16262.

It is worth noting that only a few computer languages are maintained as technical standards. These include C, C++, COBOL, Fortran and Ruby. Note that PHP, Python, Perl, Swift and Rust are privately maintained.


### ECMA ~ https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/

* https://www.ecma-international.org/technical-committees/tc39/


### W3 ~  https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script

>While the most common scripting language ECMAscript (more widely known as JavaScript) is developed by Ecma, a great many of the APIs made available in browsers have been defined at W3C.

Standards maintained by W3 include: Audio, Canvas, CORS, DOM, DOM events, EME File, Geolocation, IndexedDB, MSE, SSE, SVG, Video, WebAssembly, WebAuthn, WebGPU, WebRTC, WebSocket, WebXR, Web messaging, Web storage, Web worker, and XMLHttpRequest


### Khronos ~ https://www.khronos.org/

>Khronos royalty-free open standards for 3D graphics, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Parallel Computing, Machine Learning, and Vision Processing. Khronos develops and maintains WebGL ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL and WebCL.

W3 and Khronos are two organizations developing and maintaining standards use to generate libraries of software that are embedded in browsers and readily available to you as a JavaScript programmer.

Future editions may list more standards bodies that help regulate JavaScript features.

## Background

There is a topic and then there is talk about a topic. For example, every Wikipedia article links to a "talk" page with discussion about the article.

This section contains links to a variety of published material that defines guidelines, discusses the current state, provides warning and worries and the like.

### Background ~ Articles

The terms "Vanilla JavaScript", "Pure JavaScript" and "Plain JavaScript" are used quite frequently, but there are no hard and fast rules as to what these actually mean. On the web there appear to be just a few articles that attempt to define the category. Below are links to some of the articles we've found so far.


### Jérôme Beau: "Design: #noFramework" 2022-02-27 ~ https://javarome.medium.com/design-noframework-bbc00a02d9b3

* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30568699

>In the end, frameworks look like religions (or politics): each of them pretend to have the solution, but each of them is different. Each of them claim to provide the best vision of ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶l̶d̶ an app, but there are heated debates about which one holds the truth. Each of them requires you to follow specific rules and, while there may be similarities, it is always hard to convert from one to another.
>
>Let’s look at an “atheist” approach of frameworks: use none.

This article is a very long read covering a number of topics relating to the issues with building pages using frameworks. Nice use of summary bullets. The article incudes useful links - many of which are used in these pages. On the topic of JavaScript with no framework, it's the best summary of the issues with the most full set of links that we we have seen. _Merci beaucoup, Jérôme!_

### 2020? ~ Jeremy Likness ~ Vanilla.js (Series: 4 Parts Total) ~  https://blog.jeremylikness.com/series/vanilla.js

This page provides links to four of Jeremy's posts on vanilla .js

The posts are more of a "how-to do it" than "Why do it this way". The posts are well-organized and cover a good range of issues that developers face that can be solved with JavaScript alone.

Links with descriptions to two of the posts are listed just below.


### 2019-04-09 ~ Jeremy Likness ~ Vanilla.js — Getting Started ~ https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/2019-04-09_vanilla.jsgetting-started/

>Build web code with a zero-footprint web framework
>
>This guide shows you how to build and run a simple Vanilla.js app. You’ll use a text editor to develop your app and use the JavaScript language features that benefit every Vanilla.js project.

Here id the demo you will build:

### 2020-02-26 ~ Jeremy Likness: Build a Single Page Application (SPA) Site With Vanilla.js ~ https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/build-a-spa-site-with-vanillajs/

The one framework you don't have to install

>Modern JavaScript frameworks exist to address deficiencies in the capabilities provided out of the box by HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and WebAssembly. The latest stable version of JavaScript (ECMAScript® 2015) evolved significantly compared to earlier versions, with better control over scope, powerful string manipulation capabilities, destructuring, parameter enhancements, and the built-in implementation of classes and modules (there is no longer a need to use IIFEs or immediately-invoked function expressions). The purpose of this post is to explore how to build modern apps using the latest JavaScript features.

### 2020-10-08 ~ Jim Nielson ~ https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech/

>I have a number of old side projects which I occasionally have to revisit. The structure of these projects broadly falls under two categories:
>1. Ones I built with a mindset of having my starting point be the most basic, native web technology available. From that foundation, I enhanced functionality through layering on more sophisticated and experimental techniques, APIs, etc., where supported. All code was authored in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
>2. Ones I built with a mindset of having my starting point be abstractions of native web technology (frameworks, tooling, language sub/supersets).
>When I open an old project like number two (described above), I find entropy staring me back in the face: library updates, breaking API changes, refactored mental models, and possible downright obsolescence. An incredible amount of effort will be required to make a simple change, test it, and get it live.
>
>Conversely when I open an old project like number one (described above), I find myself relieved. A project authored in native web technologies, enhanced with an eye towards the future, with little or no tooling, leaves me facing few obstacles. Remove a couple shims that are no longer needed and that’s about it. Imagine that: you can remove code to update a project?

Nielson provides a short and rational summary as to why vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS is the most future-proof code you can write.

### 2013-12-06 ~ StackOverflow user13778911 ~ What is VanillaJS? ~ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20435653/what-is-vanillajs

>I have one simple question, that got stuck in my mind for a few days: What is VanillaJS? Some people refer to it as a framework, you can download a library from the official pages.

In referring to the "official pages, the poster is very likely referring to http://vanilla-js.com/

This website is a joke. It states "Vanilla JS is a fast, lightweight, cross-platform framework for building incredible, powerful JavaScript applications." It pretend that Vanilla JavaScript is a framework that can compete with jQuery, Dojo annd presumably React, Angular and others.

Unfortunately may naive people who google "vanilla JavaScript" get to this site and are very confused about things.

Because of the vanillajs.com  website and because [plain vanilla]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_vanilla ) is an English idiom that may not be familiar to non-English speakers, we tend tpo avoid its usage preferring "plain JavaScript".

*  https://www.amazon.com/Frameworkless-Front-End-Development-Dependencies-Controlling/dp/1484249666

>Explore an alternative method of front-end application development without using frameworks or third-party libraries. This book provides you with the required skills and freedom to consider a “no framework” approach when choosing a technology for creating a new project.
>
>You’ll work through the most important issues in a clear and sensible way, using practical methods and tools to gain an understanding of non-functional requirements. This book answers questions on important topics such as state management, making a routing system, creating a REST client using fetch, and reveals the trade-offs and risks associated with choosing the wrong framework or tool for your project, as well as providing sustainable, functional alternatives.
>
>Frameworkless Front-End Development breaks down the concept of technical debt and the ways in which a framework can impact the lifespan of a project. Along with gaining a comprehensive and clear guide on coding effectively from scratch without frameworks, you will also learn some principles of technical decision-making.

### Background ~ Web Sites

### Frameworkless Movement ~ https://www.frameworklessmovement.org/

> The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt and the availability of alternatives given by the vanilla language or by dedicated libraries.

* https://github.com/frameworkless-movement/manifesto

>Principles
>Every time that we consider the choice of a framework for a project we will use these principles to guide our choices.
>* The value of a software is not the code itself but in the reasons behind the existence of that code.
>* Every decision should be made considering the context. A good choice in a given context could be a bad choice in another one.
>* The mindful choice of a framework is a technical one and should be made by technical people, taking business needs into account.
>* The decision-making criteria that led to the choice of a framework should be known to all the members in the team.

The ideas of the Frameworkless Movement may be applied to any language, not just JavaScript.

One of the great joys of JavaScript is the huge quantity of free, open-source scripts that developes make available for you to observe, enjoy and build upon. Many scripts are plain JavaScript and many other use libraries. There are thousands of people sharing their knowledge in this manner. Below is a work-in-progress list of developers listed alphabetically by first name (following the style of Wikipedia) with links to some of their efforts that might be relevant.
