Slowly but surely, the different sections will be separated into standalone pages


## Introduction

"[Awesome List]( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/everything_but_the_kitchen_sink)" is an English idiom implying "almost everything, whether needed or not."

This repository provides lists of links to resources for developers of applications based on the JavaScript programming language. The particular emphasis here is on plain ["vanilla"]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software ) scripts that are simple, free and easy on the brain.

***

JavaScript is perhaps the [most widely used programming language]( https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages ). Almost any computing task - no matter how complicated - has been <s>hacked</s> [accomplished with JavaScript]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood#:~:text=In%202007%2C%20Jeff%20Atwood%20made,eventually%20be%20written%20in%20JavaScript.%E2%80%9D ). Some of the smartest people in the world investigate the most difficult issues using JavaScript.

But where does that leave us simple folk?

The good news:

The fastest, easiest and simplest way to get stuff on the Internet is: JavaScript

If you can type the following into a text file and drag that file into a browser, you may call yourself a programmer

``` JavaScript
<script>
    document.write("Hello, World!")
</script>
```

This repository is dedicated to helping us [KISS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle ) people play with JavaScript in simple, fun useful ways.

We want to show you that JavaScript covers a huge range of possibilities while at the same time demonstrating that much can be accomplished with tiny amounts of code.

### 2022-12-22

A new file: [journal.md]( https://plain-JavaScript.github.io/index.html#journal.md ) is added.

We are still dozens of links short of being ready to share with the world, but if you happen to stop by, please say hello by adding by opening an issue


## Target Audience

### Beginners

Are you a youngster and want to play with computers? A program that runs a JavaScript script is available on virtually computers, tablets and phones. Ditto the software to write programs - a text editor. So you can start today!


### STEAM skills but little programming experience

Are you an archeologist, violin maker, nurse-practitioner or just some one highly involved with technical things? As you already know software can provide benefit to almost any field of endeavor.

If you have never programmed, then JavaScript is fast easy way to start

If you have programmed, but aee looking to share your knowledge on the web, or create interactive apps to share or need the attributes of a game-like environment then JavaScript can be at your service.


### Programmers who write programs in languages that are not JavaScript

Are you a whizz at Python, and hold you nose when you have to lower yourself into JavaScript gobbledygook? Well, a lot of that stuff is all the tricks needed to be called a "full-stack developer". Well, if you don't need to call yourself a full-stack developer and just want to get some necessary things done in JavaScript, then there is a fully-documented, well-supported alternative: plain, ordinary JavaScript.

<br>

Well, you have come to the right place ( or will do when this list progresses a bit more)

## Reference

A reference is a link to a source of information. The links herein can help you understand the "who, what, when, where and why of JavaScript".


### Reference ~ Wikipedia & Wikimedia Foundation ~ projects relating to JavaScript

See [Reference ~ Wikipedia & Wikimedia Foundation]( #reference/reference-wikipedia-wikimedia.md )

Learn the vocabulary, history and backstory of JavaScript

### Reference ~ Technical Standards and Specifications

[Reference ~ Technical Standards and Specifications]( #reference/reference-technical-standards)

Software is not magic. Software is the consensus and collaboration of many in order to create the rules that anable a computer to operate.


## Publications

There is a topic and then there is talk about a topic. For example, every Wikipedia article links to a "talk" page with discussion about the article.

This section contains links to a variety of published material that defines guidelines, discusses the current state, provides warning and worries and the like.
